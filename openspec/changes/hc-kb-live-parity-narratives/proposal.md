# Change Proposal: hc-kb-live-parity-narratives

> **Not a rebuild input.** Archived history. Implement `openspec/specs/hc-report-engine/spec.md`. Production knowledge-base rows use `[[checks.citations]]`. This archive is not replayed.


> **STATUS: ARCHIVED**
> Merged into `openspec/specs/hc-report-engine/spec.md` on 2026-08-29.

Baseline: `openspec/specs/hc-report-engine/spec.md`. Do not modify unrelated `openspec/changes/`.

Core native KB rows listed in `tmp/hc_kb_live_parity_narratives/STUBS.txt` SHALL receive production consultant voice (`description`, `recommendation`, `verification`). Scoring fields, evaluators, and `content_from` SHALL NOT change. Alias rows SHALL stay sparse (no overlay of inherited narrative keys). This change SHALL NOT rewrite TSR alias prose or chase scorecard percent.

## Why

Scorer children minted natives with full voice. Remaining natives with stub-length `description` (strip length under 40) need the same consultant voice so Chapter 6/7 reads as a finding, not a placeholder. If the frozen list is empty, no TOML voice edits are required.
